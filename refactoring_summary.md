# Code Refactoring Summary

This document outlines the remaining tasks to ensure the codebase is fully reproducible, understandable, and adheres to best practices.

## Remaining Refactoring Tasks:

### 1. Complete Type Hinting

**Goal:** Ensure all function signatures, including arguments and return types, are fully type-hinted.

**Details:**
- Go through every Python file (`.py`) in the `src/` directory and its subdirectories.
- For each function, add type hints to all parameters and the function's return value.
- This improves code readability, enables static analysis tools, and helps prevent common errors.

### 2. Review and Enhance Docstrings

**Goal:** Provide comprehensive and consistent docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.

**Details:**
- Verify that every module, class, and function has a clear, concise, and informative docstring.
- Docstrings should explain:
    - The purpose of the code block.
    - A brief description of its functionality.
    - For functions:
        - `Args`: Description of each parameter, its type, and purpose.
        - `Returns`: Description of the return value and its type.
        - `Raises`: Any exceptions that might be raised.
- Ensure consistency in docstring format (e.g., Google, NumPy, or reStructuredText style).

### 3. Remove Redundant Imports

**Goal:** Eliminate any unused or duplicate import statements.

**Details:**
- Perform a final pass through all Python files to identify and remove imports that are no longer used or are redundant (e.g., importing the same module multiple times).
- This reduces code clutter and improves performance slightly.

### 4. Standardize Logging/Printing

**Goal:** Establish a consistent approach for outputting information, warnings, and errors.

**Details:**
- Review all `print()` statements. For a production-ready application, consider replacing them with a proper logging framework (e.g., Python's `logging` module) for better control over log levels, output destinations, and formatting.
- If sticking with `print()`, ensure messages are clear, informative, and consistently formatted.

### 5. Error Handling Review

**Goal:** Ensure robust and informative error handling across the codebase.

**Details:**
- Examine critical sections of code, especially those involving file I/O, external data fetching, or complex calculations.
- Verify that appropriate `try-except` blocks are in place to gracefully handle potential errors (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, `IndexError`, network issues).
- Ensure error messages are user-friendly and provide sufficient detail for debugging without exposing sensitive information.

Once these refactoring tasks are completed, the codebase will be significantly more robust, maintainable, and easier for others (including the CFA Quant Awards judges) to understand and reproduce.
